# Book-Store-Desktop-App-Java
This app was done as a project for OOP and Datebase. 
It is a desktop application in Java that recalled an online library which uses a database so you can login as a customer or as a library. If you would login as a 
customer you could buy books from any library that is registered on the app and as a library you could add any book you have and sell it.
Also all the information is stored in a database.
